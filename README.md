## 🚀 Production Deployment

To build and package this application for production deployment, use one of the following methods:

### Using npm scripts:
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build:prod

# Build and create compressed files
npm run deploy
```

### Using deployment scripts:
For a complete automated deployment process, run the deployment script appropriate for your OS:

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
./deploy.ps1
```

**On Linux/macOS (Bash):**
```bash
chmod +x ./deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

The deployment scripts will:
1. Install all dependencies
2. Build the application with production optimization
3. Create compressed versions of assets for better performance
4. Package everything into a timestamped ZIP file ready for deployment

The output will be available in the `dist/` directory and as a ZIP archive in the project root.

# BbornDev

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
